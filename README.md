# OS-Scripts #

Personal collection of Operating System (OS) scripts _(and related things)_.<br />
Cloned from g0tmi1k to be personalized to _my_ own needs. 

Since my preferences change from time to time, I have rewritten the first half to match what I want and expect.
Tossed all the stuff that annoyed me, so no more colorized trash and stuff, and more changes.
Remember, you can always fork and edit to match your own set of features, so head over to g0tmi1k and clone your own set :)
